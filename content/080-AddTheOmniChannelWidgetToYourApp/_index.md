The Omni-Channel utility item can be added to any Lightning Service console to route Omni-Channel work to agents. Similar to the Genesys Cloud CX for Salesforce CTI widget, this is a tool on the utility bar where agents can update their presence and manage their work.

First things first, we need to add the Omni-Channel utility tool to the same console where we have our Genesys Cloud CX for Salesforce CTI widget. Follow these steps to do that. 

1. In Salesforce, navigate to the setup portal.
